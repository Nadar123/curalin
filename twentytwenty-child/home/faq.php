                            The most popular order for new customers is the CuraLin 3-Pack,
                            as it saves you the hassle of ordering each month. However,
                            regular customers usually opt for the CuraLin 6-Pack option,
                            which gives you an even greater opportunity to save.

                        <p>
                            Our general recommendation is to take 1-2 capsules after each meal, breakfast,
                            lunch, and dinner (before going to sleep). Maximum 6 capsules per day.
                            Consulting with your doctor is always advised when using a new dietary supplement.
